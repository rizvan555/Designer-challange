          <p>
            Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
            could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted
            to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
            paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some
            challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I
            saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
            interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the
            result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

          <h4>Start with asking</h4>
          <p>
            why You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more
            effective ways of achieving goals.

          <h4>Your ideas will have more value</h4>
          <p>
            By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will
            be fresher and more valuable.
          </p>

          <h4>Design solutions with love</h4>
          <p>
            Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the
            frustration of the users and resolve to end it.
          </p>

        <div class="box4">
          <img src="./assets/resource/images/title03.svg" alt="" />
          <h4>Share and show your work</h4>
          <p>
            As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not
            finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback
            and learn from it.
