            Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
            could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted
            to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
            paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some
            challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I
            saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
            interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the
            result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

            <p>
              As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not
              finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept
              feedback and learn from it.

            The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have to

              It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected

              It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these

              and start writing down all the ideas that come to mind.

            <h4>Design your proposal</h4>
            <p>
              How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about
              features and functionality, and then start designing. Don’t forget
              to always ask yourself: Would I actually use this?
